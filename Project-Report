Objective
  To develop a deep learning model that classifies dermoscopic skin lesion images into multiple categories using transfer learning with ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 architectures.


Dataset
  Source: Kaggle - Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset
  Classes: 3 (e.g., Melanoma, Nevus, Seborrheic Keratosis)
  Total Images: ~17,800+
  Data Augmentation: Rotation, Zoom, Flip, Shift, etc.
  Split: 80% training, 20% validation


Technologies Used
  Python
  Google Colab
  TensorFlow / Keras
  Matplotlib / Seaborn / Sklearn
  Kaggle API for dataset fetching


Models Used
  1.ResNet50
      Layers frozen: first 100
      Dense + ELU + Dropout + BatchNorm
  2.EfficientNetB0
      Half layers frozen
      Dense + ELU + Dropout + BatchNorm


Training Details
  Image Size: 224 × 224
  Batch Size: 32
  Optimizer: Adam / AdamW
  Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
  Callbacks: EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint
  Epochs: Up to 20


Results
  Model	                        Validation Accuracy
  ResNet50	                        ~20%
  EfficientNetB0	                  ~60%

  EfficientNetB0 outperformed ResNet50 in validation accuracy.
  Classification reports and confusion matrices show EfficientNetB0 correctly predicted most of the dominant class.


Evaluation Metrics
  Accuracy
  Confusion Matrix
  Precision, Recall, F1-score


Conclusion
  EfficientNetB0 is more effective for skin cancer detection in this case. With better hyperparameter tuning and class balancing, results can improve further.
